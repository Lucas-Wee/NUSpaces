# NuspacesApp

##Proposed Level of Achievement:
Gemini 


##Motivation 

In University, it is easy for students to get too caught up in academics and spend time on-campus only studying in their respective faculty buildings, eating at the same nearby eateries, and seeing the same views of campus.

This shouldnâ€™t be the case! There are many excellent places around campus to visit, whether to engage in quiet contemplation, grab a bite, or just take in the vistas. Some of these spaces are known only to a precious few individuals, but deserve to be shared with others to make their time at NUS invigorating and memorable.

##Aim:

To encourage students to explore the NUS campus, through a social media app purposefully designed to share pictures of locations and categorize them by activities.
