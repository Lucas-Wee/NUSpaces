# NuspacesApp

## Proposed Level of Achievement:
Gemini 


## Motivation 

In University, it is easy for students to get too caught up in academics and spend time on-campus only studying in their respective faculty buildings, eating at the same nearby eateries, and seeing the same views of campus.

This shouldnâ€™t be the case! There are many excellent places around campus to visit, whether to engage in quiet contemplation, grab a bite, or just take in the vistas. Some of these spaces are known only to a precious few individuals, but deserve to be shared with others to make their time at NUS invigorating and memorable.

## Aim:

To encourage students to explore the NUS campus, through a social media app purposefully designed to share pictures of locations and categorize them by activities.

## User Stories:

1. As a student who has been studying in my faculty building for 1-2 years, I want to find other study locations for a change of scenery, or ones which I may find more conducive.
2. As a student who has previously not wandered far to find eateries in the interest of time, I may be interested in alternative places to eat when I have a longer break between lessons.
3. As a student who has some time to relax, I may want to venture out to a picturesque location for a quick breather, or may be looking for appropriate recreational facilities for other activities.
4. As a student who has encountered any space which could qualify for the above scenarios, I may want to raise awareness of such a space for other students to experience.
